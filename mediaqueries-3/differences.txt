This document attempts to describe the differences between the Media Queries
W3C Candidate Recommendation 6 June 2007 and the current editor's draft.

It serves as a non-normative guide for implementors interested in knowing
what has changed since the last publication.

» Clarified that is expected the forward compatible parsing rules of HTML 4
  will become obsolete in the next version of HTML in favor of just using
  the parsing rules set forth by the Media Queries specification.

» Defined the media query syntax in terms of CSS 2.1, including how user
  agents are supposed to recover from syntax errors.

» Clarified that negating an unknown media type makes it evaluate to true.

» Clarified that unknown media features make the media query malformed.

» For each media feature value it is now more clearly defined what the range
  of allowed values is. Eg, the 'width' media feature takes non-negative
  <length>s and 'grid' takes 0, -0, and 1.

» Clarified how using a media feature without value works.

» Media features prefixed with min- or max- cannot be used without a value.
  (Whether this was allowed by the 2007 CR draft is open to interpretation.)

» Defined <ratio> and <resolution> so it is more clear how these values are
  supposed to be parsed. (The 2007 CR draft is ambiguous.)


Most, if not all, of these changes are captured in public CVS:
