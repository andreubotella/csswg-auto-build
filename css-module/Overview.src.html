  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/">CSS</a> is a language for describing
  the rendering of structured documents (such as HTML and XML) on screen, on

Introduction</h2>

  <p><em>This section is not normative.</em>

  <p><var class="replaceme">Provide background, motivation, etc.</var></p>

<h3 id="placement">
Module interactions</h3>

  <p class="replaceme">Explain, normatively, how this module affects the definition of CSS.</p>

  <p>This module replaces and extends the <var class="replaceme">SUMMARIZE HERE</var>
  features defined in [[!CSS21]] sections <var class="replaceme">W.X and Y.Z</var>.

  <p class="replaceme">All properties in this module apply to the <code>::first-line</code> and
  <code>::first-letter</code> pseudo-elements.
  <!-- HANDLE, THEN REMOVE THIS COMMENT
     Properties that affect box layout should be excluded from ::first-line.
     Properties that take things out-of-flow or alter box construction should
     be excluded from both ::first-line and ::first-letter. (A special exception
     is made for float on ::first-letter, which is defined to emulate drop-caps.)
     Examples of ::first-line / ::first-letter statements:
     https://drafts.csswg.org/css3-background/#placement
       (All properties apply to ::first-letter; some apply to ::first-line)
  -->

<h3 id="values">
Values</h3>

  <p>This specification follows the
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/about.html#property-defs">CSS property
  definition conventions</a> from [[!CSS21]]. Value types not defined in
  this specification are defined in CSS Level 2 Revision 1 [[!CSS21]].
  Other CSS modules may expand the definitions of these value types: for
  example [[CSS3VAL]], when combined with this module, expands the
  definition of the <var>&lt;length&gt;</var> value type as used in this specification.</p>
  
  <p>In addition to the property-specific values listed in their definitions,
  all properties defined in this specification also accept the
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/cascade.html#value-def-inherit">inherit</a>
  keyword as their property value. For readability it has not been repeated
  explicitly.
  
<h2 id="sample-topic">
Sample section</h2>

  <p>Look at the mark-up in this section for examples. See the <a
  href="https://www.w3.org/Style/Group/css3-src/bin/README">documentation</a> for more precise instructions. The
  companion of this template shows the <a href="Overview.html">processed
  result</a>.</p>
  
  <p>To refer to HTML, use [[HTML40]] (note the double square brackets). To
  make a normative reference, insert a &ldquo;!&rdquo;, like this:
  [[!CSS3SYN]] The currently available
  <a href="http://dev.w3.org/CSS/biblio/biblio.ref">list of bibliographic data</a>
  can of course be extended.</p>
  
  <p>We write about a property such as 'display-model' like this and
  about a piece of CSS code like this: ''foo: bar''. Inline HTML and XML
  are similar, but use the CODE element: <code
  class=html>&lt;blockquote&gt;...&lt;/blockquote&gt;</code> and <code
  class=xml>&lt;r:xyz&gt;...&lt;/r:xyz&gt;</code>.
  
  <p class=note>Note that the property will automatically be linked to its
  definition.
  
  <p>To put <span class=index>terms</span> into the <span
  class=index-def>index</span>, there are many <span class=index
  title="variant">variants</span>, but hopefully the <span class=index
  title="simple|simpler|simplest">simplest</span> will be the most <span
  class=index title="frequency::common">common</span>. But a little more
  <span class=index title="work|resource::time spent">work</span> now
  will help many people for a long time.
  
  <p class=note>Note that you can add non-normative notes like this.
  
  <p>Of course, multi-paragraph notes are also possible: just enclose them in a
  DIV:
  
  <div class=note>
    <p>Note that this note is a multi-paragraph note.</p>
    <p>It doesn't <em>need</em> to have two paragraphs, but it could.</p>
  </div>
  
  <p>Displayed examples come in eight different types: CSS examples that need
  no separate paragraph of explanation are put in a simple PRE:
  
  <pre class=example>EM { font-style: italic }</pre>
  
  <p>CSS examples that need extra text need a DIV.</p>
  
  <div class=example>
  <p>The following example is the same as the previous one, but now it is
  explained:</p>
  <pre>EM { font-style: italic }</pre>
  </div>
  
  <p>Illegal CSS examples (examples of errors) are the same, but with class
  "illegal example". Examples of HTML and XML code have class "html" and "xml"
  respectively, but are otherwise ditto.</p>
  
  <p>A formal definition of a property looks like this:</p>
  
<h3 id="the-display-model">
Internal display model: the 'display-inside' property</h3>

  <table class=propdef>
    <tr>
      <th>Name:
      <td><dfn>display-inside</dfn>
    <tr>
      <th><a href="#values">Value</a>:
      <td>inline-inside | block-inside | table | ruby | icon
    <tr>
      <th>Initial:
      <td>text
    <tr>
      <th>Applies to:
      <td>all elements
    <tr>
      <th>Inherited:
      <td>no
    <tr>
      <th>Percentages:
      <td>N/A
    <tr>
      <th>Computed&nbsp;value:
      <td>specified value
    <tr>
      <th>Animatable:
      <td>no
    <tr>
      <th>Canonical order:
      <td><abbr title="follows order of property value definition">per grammar</abbr>
  </table>
  
  <dl>
    <dt><dfn>''value-name''</dfn></dt>
      <dd>Define values using a DL
  </dl>
  
  <p><dfn>Cross-references</dfn> are created by enclosing a term or phrase in
  &lt;dfn&gt; (like the word <em>cross-references</em> earlier in this
  sentence). Then any element with the same content will automatically be
  linked. For example: <span>cross-references</span>.</p>
  
  <p>And a figure with a caption is done like this:
  
  <div class=figure>
  <p><img src="corner.png"
  alt="A table with a caption above it; both have margins and the margins between them are collapsed, as is normal for vertical margins.">
  
  <p class=caption>Just a random image. SVG would be nice, but maybe SVG
  isn't sufficiently easy to use yet. W3C prefers PNG over GIF (obviously,
  since PNG is a W3C Rec).
  </div>
  
  <p>Don't forget to write the longdesc.
  
  <p class=issue>An open issue or editorial remark is OK in a WD, but
  they should be resolved/removed before the document goes to
  &ldquo;CR&rdquo; (Candidate Recommendation). Use
  class=&ldquo;issue&rdquo;.

<h2 id="conformance">
Conformance</h2>

<h3 id="conventions">
Document conventions</h3>

  <p>Conformance requirements are expressed with a combination of
  descriptive assertions and RFC 2119 terminology. The key words “MUST”,
  “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”,
  “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in the normative parts of this
  document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.
  However, for readability, these words do not appear in all uppercase
  letters in this specification.
  
  <p>All of the text of this specification is normative except sections
  explicitly marked as non-normative, examples, and notes. [[!RFC2119]]</p>
  
  <p>Examples in this specification are introduced with the words “for example”
  or are set apart from the normative text with <code>class="example"</code>,
  like this:
  
  <div class="example">
    <p>This is an example of an informative example.</p>
  </div>
  
  <p>Informative notes begin with the word “Note” and are set apart from the
  normative text with <code>class="note"</code>, like this:
  
  <p class="note">Note, this is an informative note.</p>

<h3 id="conformance-classes">
Conformance classes</h3>

  <p>Conformance to [TITLE]
  is defined for three conformance classes:
  <dl>
    <dt><dfn title="style sheet!!as conformance class">style sheet</dfn>
      <dd>A <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#style-sheet">CSS
      style sheet</a>.
    <dt><dfn>renderer</dfn></dt>
      <dd>A <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#user-agent">UA</a>
      that interprets the semantics of a style sheet and renders
      documents that use them.
    <dt><dfn id="authoring-tool">authoring tool</dfn></dt>
      <dd>A <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#user-agent">UA</a>
      that writes a style sheet.
  </dl>
  
  <p>A style sheet is conformant to [TITLE]
  if all of its statements that use syntax defined in this module are valid
  according to the generic CSS grammar and the individual grammars of each
  feature defined in this module.
  
  <p>A renderer is conformant to [TITLE]
  if, in addition to interpreting the style sheet as defined by the
  appropriate specifications, it supports all the features defined
  by [TITLE] by parsing them correctly
  and rendering the document accordingly. However, the inability of a
  UA to correctly render a document due to limitations of the device
  does not make the UA non-conformant. (For example, a UA is not
  required to render color on a monochrome monitor.)
  
  <p>An authoring tool is conformant to [TITLE]
  if it writes style sheets that are syntactically correct according to the
  generic CSS grammar and the individual grammars of each feature in
  this module, and meet all other conformance requirements of style sheets
  as described in this module.

<h3 id="partial">
Partial implementations</h3>

  <p>So that authors can exploit the forward-compatible parsing rules to
  assign fallback values, CSS renderers <strong>must</strong>
  treat as invalid (and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#ignore">ignore
  as appropriate</a>) any at-rules, properties, property values, keywords,
  and other syntactic constructs for which they have no usable level of
  support. In particular, user agents <strong>must not</strong> selectively
  ignore unsupported component values and honor supported values in a single
  multi-value property declaration: if any value is considered invalid
  (as unsupported values must be), CSS requires that the entire declaration
  be ignored.</p>
  
<h3 id="experimental">
Experimental implementations</h3>

  <p>To avoid clashes with future CSS features, the CSS2.1 specification
  reserves a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#vendor-keywords">prefixed
  syntax</a> for proprietary and experimental extensions to CSS.
  
  <p>Prior to a specification reaching the Candidate Recommendation stage
  in the W3C process, all implementations of a CSS feature are considered
  experimental. The CSS Working Group recommends that implementations
  use a vendor-prefixed syntax for such features, including those in
  W3C Working Drafts. This avoids incompatibilities with future changes
  in the draft.
  </p>
 
<h3 id="testing">
Non-experimental implementations</h3>

  <p>Once a specification reaches the Candidate Recommendation stage,
  non-experimental implementations are possible, and implementors should
  release an unprefixed implementation of any CR-level feature they
  can demonstrate to be correctly implemented according to spec.
  
  <p>To establish and maintain the interoperability of CSS across
  implementations, the CSS Working Group requests that non-experimental
  CSS renderers submit an implementation report (and, if necessary, the
  testcases used for that implementation report) to the W3C before
  releasing an unprefixed implementation of any CSS features. Testcases
  submitted to W3C are subject to review and correction by the CSS
  Working Group.
  
  <p>Further information on submitting testcases and implementation reports
  can be found from on the CSS Working Group's website at
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/">http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/</a>.
  Questions should be directed to the
  <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite">public-css-testsuite@w3.org</a>
  mailing list.

<h3 id="cr-exit-criteria">
CR exit criteria</h3>

  <p class="replaceme">Remove this section unless/until the module is in CR.</p>

  <!-- This text was <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Tracker/actions/44"> decided on 2008-06-04.</a> -->

  <p>
  For this specification to be advanced to Proposed Recommendation,
  there must be at least two independent, interoperable implementations
  of each feature. Each feature may be implemented by a different set of
  products, there is no requirement that all features be implemented by
  a single product. For the purposes of this criterion, we define the
  following terms:
  
  <dl>
    <dt>independent <dd>each implementation must be developed by a
    different party and cannot share, reuse, or derive from code
    used by another qualifying implementation. Sections of code that
    have no bearing on the implementation of this specification are
    exempt from this requirement.
  
    <dt>interoperable <dd>passing the respective test case(s) in the
    official CSS test suite, or, if the implementation is not a Web
    browser, an equivalent test. Every relevant test in the test
    suite should have an equivalent test created if such a user
    agent (UA) is to be used to claim interoperability. In addition
    if such a UA is to be used to claim interoperability, then there
    must one or more additional UAs which can also pass those
    equivalent tests in the same way for the purpose of
    interoperability. The equivalent tests must be made publicly
    available for the purposes of peer review.
  
    <dt>implementation <dd>a user agent which:
  
    <ol class=inline>
      <li>implements the specification.
  
      <li>is available to the general public. The implementation may
      be a shipping product or other publicly available version
      (i.e., beta version, preview release, or “nightly build”). 
      Non-shipping product releases must have implemented the
      feature(s) for a period of at least one month in order to
      demonstrate stability.
  
      <li>is not experimental (i.e., a version specifically designed
      to pass the test suite and is not intended for normal usage
      going forward).
    </ol>
  </dl>
  
  <p>The specification will remain Candidate Recommendation for at least
  six months.
