  <p>The image looks like a definition list, i.e., a list of terms,
  each with an indented definition below it. The list is divided over
  three columns. The first column has the terms “granite” and
  “limestone” with their definitions. The second column has the terms
  “falcon” and “rabbit.” The last one has “olive” and “pine.”
