  <title>Description of the image</title>
  <link rel=alternate type="image/png" href="footnotes.png">

  <p>The image shows two lines of text at the top, some empty space
  below it with an ellipsis near the bottom, and below that a line of
  text in a smaller font. The first line of text contains the nonsense
  text “The balubious coster of the fifth secter of The Rollow Carpug
  mentizes a costernica.” There is a small, superscript digit “1”
  after the word “secter.”

  <p>The line of text at the bottom starts with a digit “1” and a
  period, followed by the nonsense text “The sixth secter coster is a
  difter manon.”
