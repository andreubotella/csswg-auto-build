  <title>Description of the image</title>
  <link rel=alternate type="image/svg+xml" href="cutout.svg">

  <p>The image shows a stylized page, with horizontal lines
  representing text lines. Along the top are four lines, left-aligned
  and a bit wider than half the width of the image. Below them are two
  columns of text. A little below the center of the page is a
  rectangle representing an image that overlaps both of the columns.
  The text in the columns wraps around the image: the text in the left
  column wraps around the left side, the text in the right column
  wraps around the right side of the image.
