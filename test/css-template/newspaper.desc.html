  <title>Description of the image</title>
  <link rel=alternate type="image/png" href="newspaper.png">

  <p>The image shows a simplified rendering of a newspaper page, with
  an image, some titles in different fonts, and the rest of the text
  suggested by horizontal lines. The page has five columns, although
  some text spans more than one column. Some vertical and horizontal
  rules visually divide the page into regions.

  <p>In the bottom right corner of some of these regions is text such
  as “page 7” with an arrow, suggesting that the rest of the text of
  this region can be found on page 7 of the newspaper.
