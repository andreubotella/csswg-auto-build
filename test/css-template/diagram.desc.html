  <p>The image shows a rectangle in the middle that represents a
  displayed page. The page is divided into four regions. Region a is a
  narrow strip along the top of the page. The rest of the page is
  divided into three columns, labeled from left to right with letters
  b, c and d. They have different widths.

  <p>Around the page rectangle are smaller images, connected to the
  page by arrows.

  <p>An image above the page shows a stylized mountain range and
  represents the general notion of image. An arrow goes from this
  image to region a.

  <p>An image on the right shows, from top to bottom, some horizontal
  lines (representing text), an irregular shape (representing an
  image) and more horizontal lines. The whole represents a typical
  section in a document, with some text and some images. An arrow goes
  from this image to region d.

  <p>An image below the page is similar but different, with some
  horizontal lines and an irregular shape. An arrow goes from this
  image to region c.

  <p>An image on the left of the page shows only some horizontal
  lines. It might represent a piece of a document with only text,
  maybe a table of contents. An arrow goes from this image to
  region b.
