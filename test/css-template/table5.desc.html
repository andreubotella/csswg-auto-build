  <p>The image shows a rendering of the example. The image is a
  rectangle, about four times as wide as high. Some thin, red lines
  are drawn over the image to help show how various parts of the text
  align to each other.

  <p>The rectangle has four columns of text. The first column has one
  line, consisting of a list bullet and the text “navigation.”

  <p>The second column has two lines of text: “Weather” in a big, bold
  font and “There will be weather” below that.

  <p>The third column has five pieces of text: “Football,” “People
  like football,” “Chess,” “There was a brawl at the chess tournament”
  and “Copyright some folks.” The first and second are in a big, bold
  font.

  <p>The last column has two lines of text: “Your Horoscope” in a big,
  bold font and “You're going to die (eventually).”
