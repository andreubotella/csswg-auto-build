    <title>Description of the “page.png” image</title>

    <p>The image shows what could be a page from a book. The top half
    has greeked lines of text and a centered drawing of something that
    looks vaguely like a slab of stone. The bottom half has more
    greeked text, which wraps around a kind of circular drawing
    against the right edge.

    <p>Between the two halves, right in the middle of the page, is a
    full-width box about three lines high with a black
    border. Centered in that box is one line of text, which reads: “My
    Magazine - page 7 - February 2013”.
