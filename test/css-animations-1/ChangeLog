- And remove the issue that the previous change was
  addressing.

- Change ordering requirements for parsing keywords
  within the animation shorthand to prioritize animation-name lowest,
  and also require nonambiguous serialization with allowance for being
  non-minimal (which we could perhaps tighten later).

  Fixes: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-
  style/2014Jan/0325.html http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-
  style/2011Apr/0344.html

- Remove issue proposing alternative syntax for times
  in animation shorthand, which is no longer practical at this point.

- Define the term "animation properties" and also
  cite the rules on list matching in the definition of the animation
  shorthand.

  Fixes the remainder of http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-
  style/2011Oct/0408.html which was partly fixed by the previous
  commit.

- Use term "animation properties" consistently.

- Make it clear that "first value" and "second value"
  refer to being within a <single-animation>.

  Fixes http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-
  style/2011Oct/0410.html

2014-01-08  L. David Baron  <dbaron@dbaron.org>
- Have 2 separate links for issues
  list, the first excluding issues deferred to next level.

2013-09-10  L. David Baron  <dbaron@dbaron.org>
- Describe how animations interact with the cascade
  in a slightly more formally-correct way, and a way more similar to
  transitions.

- Cite cascade spec for cascading rules.

2013-09-05  Rebecca Hauck  <rhauck@adobe.com>
- added test annotations & test suite links

2013-05-06  L. David Baron  <dbaron@dbaron.org>
- Actually, since we don't have
  init*Event, there's no point worrying about document.createEvent, so
  so we can just put the defaults in the init dict.

- Define initial values of event
  properties. (Using the initializers in the init dict is not
  sufficient because of CreateEvent.) Also fix link to DOM Core.

2013-04-04  L. David Baron  <dbaron@dbaron.org>
- Fix double-brackets (an escaped set and an incorrectly unescaped
  set) in the feedback mailto: URLs.

  This fixes a mistake introduced in: changeset: 7856:589545d6b465
