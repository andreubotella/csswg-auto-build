  <p>The image is a square with smaller squares in the corners. The
  four squares all have the same size, but different colors: green in
  the top left corner, red in the top right, purple in the bottom
  right and blue in the bottom left. In the center is a yellow square
  that is larger than the other four and whose corners overlap the
  corners of the other four. The remaining space is transparent.
