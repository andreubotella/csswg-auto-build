  <p>The image shows a rectangle, about twice as wide as high, with a
  thin border around it. If you imagine the rectangle to be divided
  into three rows and two columns, then the six cells contain:

  <ul>
    <li>Top left: the left-aligned text “Enter minimum value:”
    <li>Top right: an empty box for text entry
    <li>Middle left: the left-aligned text “Enter maximum value:”
    <li>Middle right: an empty box for text entry
    <li>Bottom left: a right-aligned button with the label “OK”
    <li>Bottom right: a right-aligned button with the label “Reset”
  </ul>
