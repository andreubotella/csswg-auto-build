The current version of the CSS Fonts spec uses Bert's old preprocessor
tool rather than Bikeshed. This will continue until Bikeshed can
distinguish between properties and descriptors with identical names
(e.g. font-weight as a style property vs. font-weight as an @font-face
rule descriptor).

Spec files:

  Fonts.src.html - spec source
  Fonts.html - spec output by preprocessor (directory index points *here*!!)
  Overview.html - used when preparing specs for publication (*not* the ED!!)
  Overview-wip.bs - initial attempt to create a Bikeshed version of the fonts spec
